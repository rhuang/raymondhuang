# Someday, I'm going to have that job

I came across this picture and found the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69VNyBgnJGE). It was taken on July 24th 1963, on a bright summer day, in the White House Rose Garden.

Bill Clinton had pushed and muscled his way to the front in order to meet the president. Immediately following this picture is another frame in the video where Clinton is looking down at the hand that just shook the president's, probably thinking "I'm never going to wash this hand again". Following the handshake, Clinton turned around and said to his classmates that someday, he was going have JFK's job and become president. His classmates laughed and didn't take him seriously.

This is impressive to me. Clinton knew exactly what his goal was, since he was a kid, and it seems like every decision he made was to enable him to move 1 step closer towards his goal. He was confident and saw himself worthy of that position. I am disappointed to say that I did not have such ambitions, drive, and motivation growing up.

Who would have thought that in four months, JFK would be dead and in 30 years, Bill Clinton would be the 42nd president of the United States.

These two images speak volumes about being determined and disciplined to reach your goals, no matter how high and lofty they are.
