# Israel

# SIM Card

I highly recommend using https://www.simtoisrael.com/. I purchased a 14 day plan for \$35, and the SIM card was delivered to my hostel before I arrived. The plan includes a local number, 40 GB of data, unlimited call and text to the US, Canada, and within Israel. I faced some issues activating the SIM card and emailed their support for assistance, and they were very quick to respond and help me activate the SIM card.

Alternatively, you can try to find the Steimetzky store at the airport, on the 3rd floor, after the baggage claim in the arrival hall. Steimetzky is like a convenient store that will carry prepaid SIM cards that tourists can buy. Their lighted sign is green and white and there should be a red SIM card shaped sign in the middle of their signage.

## Luxembourg to Tel Aviv

{{< columns >}}

I took a 10am flight from Luxembourg, with a transfer in Frankfurt, and landed at the Ben Gurion airport in Israel at 3pm. Going through customs was fairly straight forward, with the the usual questions about why you are visiting and where you are staying.

With a combination of instructions on the hostel website and Google Maps, I managed to find my way onto the train in the airport that takes you to the Tel Aviv Ha'Hagana station. From there, I took a bus to the [Little Tel Aviv Hostel](https://www.littletlvhostel.com/). I read online that you can also take a Sherut, which is a shared taxi, but I never figured out how to find, flag down, and board one.

## Dinner at Saluf and Sons

For dinner, I walked over to [Saluf and Sons](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293984-d8328273-Reviews-Saluf_and_Sons-Tel_Aviv_Tel_Aviv_District.html) and sat at the bar. The bartender was nice and recommended their most popular dish, the Shawia. He also offered a shot of arak, a licorice-flavored liquor, to all of us sitting at the bar. I chatted with a Russian woman, Mariah, who moved to Tel Aviv a few years ago in search of better job opportunities. She talked about her sense of disillusionment after working for a few years in Moscow, because she witnessed time and time again corruption, nepotism, and dirty tactics in the workplace at all levels of employees and management. After dinner, Mariah took me to a few convenient stores around the block where I could try the local nuts and dried fruits.

## Pub crawl

After dinner, I went back to the hostel and joined the pub crawl. We jumped between a few bars on Rothschild Boulevard. I was shocked by how expensive drinking in Tel Aviv is. At the first bar we went to, I was getting a round of drinks for 2 other guys, and 3 beers came out to about 100 shekels, which is about $30. I thought I was being scammed because I'm a tourist, but it turns out a beer is about $10 in a bar. It was nice the pub crawl didn't take us to those foreigner-only bars that make the whole night feel like a scam. The bars we went to had plenty of local Israelis out and about.

## Palmach Museum

You have to make an online tour reservation at the Palmach Museum in order to visit. I woke up with a hangover to go to my 10:30am reservation, but on arrival, I was told by the security at the museum that the museum was closed the day. I bussed back to the hostel to take a nap.

## Beach Front

In the afternoon, I walked over to the beachfront. The weather was great and people were out and about. I probably walked for about 2 hours up and down the coast.

For lunch, I ate at [Nina Cafe](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293984-d2590053-Reviews-Nina_Cafe_Bistro-Tel_Aviv_Tel_Aviv_District.html) and sat outside. The food was mediocre, serving up the typical sandwiches. I ordered a goat cheese sandwich. I ate here regardless because I was starving, also wanted a coffee, and the cafe was in a bustling spot in [Neve Tzedek](https://www.timeout.com/israel/things-to-do/the-ultimate-guide-to-neve-tzedek), which made it awesome to rest and people watch.
